## The plan for year three of University

Year three of University is one that I've put a lot of thought into, mainly because I haven't had as much to fill my time while in America as I did in my first year.  In theory, the year can be broken down quite easily into three seperate components - academics, social and economic, although the three tend to intersect fairly often.  The aim of this post is too visualise and plan for what I'll do in these three aspects of life.  For simplicity, I'll be counting my third year of as from when I arrive back in England (sometime in May/early June) up until early July of 2023.  This will include the fourish month period between which I arrive back in England and when I start third year.

## Academics

In theory, my third year of University should be easier than I originally expected.  One of the major benefits of taking a year abroad has been that my grades have improved (3.7 GPA at this point).  I'm still unsure on how the conversion back to English grades will work, but provided I maintian my current level of attainment in my second semester in America, I should be in a relatively strong position heading into my third year.  Therefore, I won't need to make any major changes before I undertake my third year, although it is possible that I'll need to re-evaluate these plans nearer to the start date.  The only other thing I'll need to consider will be the shift back to the UK grading system, which is significantly less focussed on homeworks and consistent work, and much more on final examinations.  In my opinion, this format is much less forgiving, so I'll need to make sure I'm aware of this difference from the start.  

## Social

Out of the three components making up this article, this is the one that I'm most uncertain about.  Historical evidence doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that I'll come back to the UK and find a huge group of friends, which isn't necessarily the worst thing in the World.  Saying that, this year I've found a group of friends who I'm involved with, and would say that to some extent, am popular.  Obviously a significant proportion of this is down to the accent (I think it's unlikely upon returning to the UK that people will instantly like me because I speak differently), but it shouldn't be that I condemn myself to the idea that I'll absolutely have no friends in my third year (and I'm not, if you're reading this Dad).  It'll be important that I actively involve myself in clubs and societies, having been away for a year, but I'm not overly stressed about this, I've always enjoyed those clubs anyway.  

The bigger issue to be navigated will be my first year flatmates.  While they are great people, who I get on with, I also have effectively nothing in common with them.  That's been one of the biggest changes I've noticed on my year abroad, and not necessarily one that I've disliked.  I'm hoping that I can find a mix between new friends and my first year friends, although judging from first year this might be slightly difficult - we'll see.

##  Economics

Once again, big part of my life (probably too big).  I've spent most of this year thinking of the economics of my third year, mainly as a way of coping with the fact that I haven't been making as much money as I want to be.  The good news, is that having thought about it so much, I have a very clear idea of what the plan is when I get back to England.  Obviously matched betting is at the centre of this plan, although there is some level of investments and other ideas I'm playing with.  
Quantity is going to be the key for a successful third year in my opinion.  It's key that as soon as possible I begin setting up client account sets, and thinking of ways I can expand the base.  As an approximate number, I can guarantee three account sets upon return (parents and brother).  Along with this, I'll be able to sign up one of my flat mates from first year, and probably another friend who has already opened some accounts.  This brings the total account sets to 6 (although only three of these sets will be healthy).  While a good starting point, if I want to maximise third year, the goal will always be to expand the base.  The plan is going to be to pay each client a proportional amount of 20% of the net profit (or gross, whichever one means I won't be screwed over here, one for you dad).  Therefore, I'm always going to be paying out 20%, but prevent myself from being in a situation where I'm stuck paying someone extra monthly even after their accounts are dead.  I'll probably need to renegotiate the numbers when more accounts start dying, but it'll be a good starting point.

In terms of attracting more clients, a referral system is going to be useful, although the logistics of this will need to be ironed out.  I need to find a suitable number at which people will bother asking friends if they want to be involved, but also viable for me to actually pay it out.  £100 for a referrer seems like a reasonable number, should make that back from the signup offers.  Additionally, I'm going to try and train up a few shop runners (at a guess, my brother and maybe one of my flatmates for next year), who can head down to the shops for top price arbs, which should make £500 lockins on top price weeks possible.  This'll require some work though, and might be easier said than done.

Eventually the goal will be to have approximately 10 sets of accounts, which seems reasonable thinking about it, I've already accounted for 5 effectively guaranteed, and that's not considering other people who I can ask, and anyone that might be referred.  It's unlikely than anyone from 18-21 is going to say no to a consistent £100 a month minimum for no effort.  Based off of the assumption that I can have 10 client sets, £5000 per month should be easily achievable, while effectively just scratching the surface of profit available.  With this many sets I should be able to delve into casino offers as well, being able to repeat the offers will flatten the variance curve significantly.  

Based off these predictions, I think a sensible aim for the end of year 3 will be £50,000 net worth.  Admittedly when the number is written like that it actually seems like a fair amount more than I originally thought, but when you break the numbers down it's not that bad.  I'm at £15,000 ish at the moment (probably a bit more but I haven't done accounting in a while), so it's about £3000 per month for the year to reach there.  Hopefully I'll be able to do a lot of the work for this before the year even starts, so I can focus fairly entirely on the third year of uni when I need to.

Theres more that I've got planned, but Grosvenor just confiscated a decent amount of my winnings, so I should probably go and focus on that...  RIP to that profit.
