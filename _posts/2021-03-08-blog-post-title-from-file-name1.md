## My life goals at 19

I thought it'd be interesting to start a yearly list I can compile of the things I want to accomplish in my life, which I'm presuming will change as I grow up.  As the title suggests, this is the goal list from when I'm 19 (my current age), I'll start the next list in a few months time on my 20th birthday.  The lists aren't finished, I'll update them throughout the year, and likely go back in time and tick things off if I ever manage them.

**The list**
-   Reach £1,000,000 net worth
-   Finish the apple ecosystem
-   Own my own home - drink a dark fruits in it
-   Have a 5 figure week (as in £10,000+ earnt)
-   Have a 5 figure day (veru ambitious...)
-   Have a 4 figure day (£1,000 earnt) ✅
-   Have a 4 figure week ✅
