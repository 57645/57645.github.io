This is my second blog technically, the first one probably shouldn't count.

I plan to talk about anything and everything, including stuff that I'm currently doing, stuff that I wish I was doing, and stuff that I plan to be doing (and opinions I have that I'm not confident enough about to actively debate with anyone).

Posts will vary in readbability and quality likely, but hopefully they should keep coming.

Feel free to contact me.
